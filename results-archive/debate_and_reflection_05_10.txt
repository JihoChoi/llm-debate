The order of operations is followed, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (performed from left to right), and addition and subtraction (performed from left to right).\n2. There are no parentheses or exponents, so we begin with the multiplication and division. This means we first multiply 17 and 25, which is 425, and then multiply 19 and 28, which is 532.\n3.
