This is because multiplication and division should be performed before addition and subtraction. \n\nOne way to show this is to recognize that anything multiplied by 0 is 0. Therefore, 15*0 is 0, leaving the expression as 15+0+18-3*24. We can then multiply 3*24, which is 72, making the expression 15+0+18-72.
